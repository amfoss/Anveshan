# Core Tasks

### TASK 00: CODEFORCES

[Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) is a competitive programming platform that hosts contests, problem sets, and educational resources, helping users enhance their algorithmic and problem-solving skills. It features a rating system that motivates programmers to improve and engage with a global community through discussions and shared solutions. Codeforces is widely used by students, professionals, and anyone looking to sharpen their coding abilities and prepare for technical challenges.

* Every weekend, practice the latest problems in your rating range and time yourself when doing them.
* Solve problems rated 1400 or under to elevate your rating to 1400+ (cyan)
* Upon solving each problem, reflect on the techniques and mindset used and how you could generalize the thought process to solve other problems more efficiently. **Add its code with the problem's title as the filename. Also, upload your Codeforces profile link.**

### TASK 01: GIT

[Git exercises](https://gitexercises.fracz.com/) is a great platform to help you learn and practice Git and discover its features you might not have been aware of. Additionally, [learn git branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) provides an interactive way to learn Git through graphs, offering visual and hands-on practice with branching, merging, rebasing, and other Git concepts.

* Complete all exercises in Git exercises and take a screenshot of the congratulatory page and upload it to your repository.
* **Write a blog about this task**, detailing your solutions to each exercise with necessary explanations. You can write a summary, publish a blog on Medium, or even post it on your personal website.

Every application or website follows a journey known as **The development cycle**. It begins with understanding what needs to be built and ends with a working product available to user.

It includes:

1. **SRS Document** – defines the goals, features, and requirements.
2. **Wireframe** – outlines the layout and structure of the app or website.
3. **Figma Design** – adds color, style, and interactivity to the wireframes.
4. **Development** – builds the actual product, covering both frontend and backend.

Your task is to create **MeloFi**, a platform that lets users explore, play, and manage music across web and mobile. Users should be able to discover tracks, build playlists, follow other users, and enjoy a rich audio experience. U can take a look at [Spotify](https://spotify.com) or [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/) for examples.

### TASK 02: SRS

The development process starts with a **Software Requirements Specification (SRS)** document. It is a comprehensive document detailing a software system's requirements. It clearly defines what the app will do, who will use it, and what features it must include. It provides a shared understanding among developers, designers, and stakeholders. It's an essential step to align everyone involved in the project.

Create a basic SRS document for MeloFi. Include project overview, goals, target users, core features, and basic tech stack.

### TASK 03: Wireframe

Wireframes are low-fidelity layouts that define the structure, navigation flow, and layout of the website and app. They help you visualize user flow, screen hierarchy, and layout structure, making it easier to plan interactions and navigation before adding detailed designs.

Using tools like [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) or [Moqups](https://www.figma.com/), create wireframes **for both web and mobile,** showing the placement of content, buttons, navigation, and other interface elements of MeloFi.

**Expected features**

1. Login / Signup.
2. Home Screen/Dashboard – Displays recommended and recently played songs.
3. Shows song details, album art, and playback controls when a song is being played.
4. Playlist / Liked Songs – Users can view and manage their playlists.
5. Search functionality to search for specific tracks.

### TASK 04: Design

Once wireframes are ready, they are transformed into high-fidelity designs. This step focuses on visual aesthetics, and responsiveness across devices. Designers add colors, typography, icons, images, and interactive elements, creating a realistic representation of the final product. The design phase ensures that the user interface is intuitive, attractive, and consistent across both web and mobile platforms.

Make a copy of your Figma wireframes from TASK 03 and convert them into **fully designed website and mobile app**. Add color, typography, icons, and interactions.
