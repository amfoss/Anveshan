# Introduction

The Anveshan Curriculum is designed to help the new members at amFOSS to get started with development through a hands-on, flexible learning path. This curriculum ensures that everyone builds a strong foundation across all major domains, while also giving you the freedom to explore and specialize based on your interests. You’ll learn by completing small practical challenges that mirror real-world problem-solving in software engineering.

## Structure

#### **Core Tasks** <a href="#core-tasks" id="core-tasks"></a>

These tasks build essential skills every developer should have as they form the foundation of your technical journey, ensuring you understand how software is built, managed, and shared.\
These are not just prerequisites. They’re the skills you’ll rely on, no matter which specialization you pursue later.

#### **Track-Specific Tasks**

Each track has a **basic task** with a set of **optional features** that you can explore to go deeper into that domain.

* Every student **must complete the basic task of each track.** These are designed to ensure that everyone builds the essential skills required across domains and are hence **mandatory for everyone**.
* If you’re particularly interested in a domain (mobile, web or systems), you are encouraged to go beyond the basics and implement the optional features provided for its respective task **within its given deadline**.

## Submission Guidelines

* Create a public GitHub repository named `amfoss-curriculum`
* Make directories titled as `task-##`  for each task where `##` is the task number.
*   In the **README.md**, clearly list which tasks you completed at the **basic level** and which ones you extended with **optional features**. You may follow the example format given below

    | Task Name | Level Completed   |
    | --------- | ----------------- |
    | Task ##   | Optional Features |
    | Task ##   | Basic             |
    | Task ##   | Basic             |
* Inside each task directory, include a README.md file that contains a brief explanation of your approach and a small review or reflection on what you learned from the task.
